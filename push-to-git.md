# Push Current Codebase to Git Repository

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Git installed and configured on your system.

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```

## Step 2: Add Remote Repository
Replace `<your-repository-url>` with your actual repository URL:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

Example URLs:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`
- GitLab: `https://gitlab.com/username/repository-name.git`
- Bitbucket: `https://bitbucket.org/username/repository-name.git`

## Step 3: Stage All Files
```bash
git add .
```

## Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Media Competition Platform

- Complete React app with user profiles and media upload
- Competition creation and voting system
- Premium UI with Framer Motion animations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Local storage data persistence"
```

## Step 5: Push to Repository
For first push to a new repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

For subsequent pushes:
```bash
git push
```

## Alternative: If you need to force push (use with caution)
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

## Verify Push
After pushing, you can verify by:
1. Visiting your repository URL in a browser
2. Checking that all files are present
3. Verifying the commit message appears correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Remote repository not empty
If you get an error about the remote having commits, you can:
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Authentication required
Make sure you're authenticated with your Git provider:
- GitHub: Use personal access token or SSH key
- GitLab/Bitbucket: Use credentials or SSH key

### Issue: Branch name mismatch
If your default branch is `master` instead of `main`:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Next Steps After Push
1. Set up branch protection rules (recommended)
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline if needed
3. Add collaborators if working in a team
4. Set up issue tracking and project management
